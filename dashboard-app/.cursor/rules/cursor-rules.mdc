# Cursor rules location

1. Always place rule files in PROJECT_ROOT/.cursor/rules:
```
.cursor/rules/
|__ your-rule-name.mdc
|__ another-rule.mdc
|__ 
```

2. Follow the naming convention
- Use Kebab-case for filenames
- Always ise .mdc extension
- Make names descriptive of the rule's purpose

3. Directory Structure:
```
PROJECT_ROOT/
|__ .cursor/
    |__ rules/
        |__ your-rule-name.mdc
        |__ ...

```

4. Never place rule files:
- In the project root
- In subdirectories outside .cursor/rules
- In any other location


5. Cursor rules have the following structure:
