# Next.js App Router Structure

1. Use the App Router directory structure:
   - `app/page.tsx` - Home page component
   - `app/layout.tsx` - Root layout with providers
   - `app/(routes)/[route]/page.tsx` - Route pages
   - `app/api/[...]/route.ts` - API endpoints (non-tRPC)

2. Component organization:
   - Place reusable components in `app/components/`
   - Group related components in subdirectories
   - Use "use client" directive only when necessary

3. Data fetching:
   - Prefer Server Components for data fetching
   - Use React Query hooks with tRPC in Client Components
   - Implement proper loading states and error boundaries
