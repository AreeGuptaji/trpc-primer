# Authentication Patterns

1. NextAuth.js setup:
   - Configure providers in `app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`
   - Use Prisma adapter for database integration
   - Define session and JWT callbacks as needed

2. Protected routes:
   - Use server-side session validation
   - Implement client-side auth state with React context
   - Create protected route wrappers
   

3. User management:
   - Store user data in Prisma database
   - Implement proper session handling
   - Use proper typing for user objects
