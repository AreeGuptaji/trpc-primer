# Prisma Conventions

1. Schema organization:
   - Define models in `prisma/schema.prisma`
   - Use descriptive field names and comments
   - Implement proper relations between models
   - Use enums for fixed value sets

2. Database operations:
   - Access Prisma client through tRPC context
   - Use transactions for multi-operation changes
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Use Prisma's filtering and selection capabilities

3. Migrations:
   - Generate migrations with `npx prisma migrate dev`
   - Add descriptive names to migrations
   - Review migration files before applying
   - Never edit migration files after they've been applied
