# TypeScript Standards

1. Type definitions:
   - Define shared types in `types/` directory
   - Use proper typing for all functions and components
   - Avoid `any` type - use `unknown` when type is uncertain
   - Leverage TypeScript's utility types when appropriate

2. Type imports:
   - Use explicit imports for types
   - Import types from their source modules
   - Define component prop types inline or in separate interfaces

3. Type safety:
   - Enable strict mode in tsconfig.json
   - Use type guards for runtime type checking
   - Implement proper error handling with typed errors
   - Use discriminated unions for complex state management
